## Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn`
3. Run `npm run start`
4. Open a chromium based browser and load the `/build` folder as unpacked extension.
5. The extension should be loaded with hot-reload enabled.

## Reference 
- The chrome extension boilerplate is cloned from [here](https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react) to quickly setup all build tools and integrate react with typescript.
